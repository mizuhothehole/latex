1.latex is a typeset application which is the best way to make typesettings. And another way to typeset is macrosoft word.

2.latex can be compiled to many kinds of files，like the most popular file the pdf file.

3.the best way to make latex compiled files are using tex-live engine（background） and texmaker editor（foreground）

4.the latex is like document［］｛｝，and I do not know the real meaning of them because they seem not very clear
